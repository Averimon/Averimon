# Florian Wohlmuth

Computer Science Master's student at TU Graz with a strong focus on interactive systems, game technology and applied software engineering.

I enjoy building projects at the intersection of **games, research, UX, and real-world applications** — especially when they involve clean system architecture, meaningful user interaction and a bit of creativity.
